1. Dashboard UI Modernization
You redesigned the dashboard for a modern, dark look using ttkbootstrap.
The layout was improved for 800x650 resolution, with better spacing, larger fonts, and clear sectioning.
The "Save All" button was placed inside the Hotkey Configuration section, matching your design.

2. Language Selection Bug Fix
Fixed the bug where clicking the language radio button multiple times would toggle the language unexpectedly.
Now, selecting a language sets it directly, only if itâ€™s different from the current language.

3. Hotkey Saving and Live Update
Fixed the issue where changing hotkeys and clicking "Save All" did not update the actual hotkeys in the running app.
Added a register_hotkeys method to the main app (TextReader) to unregister and re-register hotkeys from settings.
Now, hotkey changes take effect immediately after saving.

4. Settings Robustness
Fixed a crash when saving the language setting if the [General] section was missing in settings.ini.
Updated the settings.py to automatically add missing sections before saving.

5. Error Handling and Logging
Fixed an error where the app tried to use a non-existent logger attribute in TextReader.
Provided options to either add a logger or remove the logging line for simplicity.

6. User Feedback
The dashboard now shows a confirmation message when settings are saved.

7. General Code Quality
Improved code structure and maintainability.
Ensured all UI and hotkey changes are robust and user-friendly.
